Comments to the author
======================

It is true that inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental
problem in motion and trajectory planning of robotic
manipulators. This paper presented a search based inverse
kinematic solver by exploiting the geometry of a 7DoF
redundant manipulator with offsets at shoulder, elbow and
wrist, respectively. Following the geometry based fact of
the redundant manipulator, an inverse kinematics algorithm
was presented and validated with the commercial 7DoF
redundant Baxter robot. 

Some remarks are listed below:
1) In general, the motivation of this work is explicitly
stated and the paper is well written. The proposed geometry
based IK solver could be used for real robots where the
existing solver fails to find any solutions.
2) One potential drawback of a geometry based algorithm for
IK is the cost of solving time. For example, the solve time
given in this work is 6-9s. Can the authors compare the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm with existing
algorithm in the scenarios both algorithms can provide
solutions? This could be then used as an parameter in the
metric to help users to select solvers for various tasks.

3rd columns..' from where?
5) Eq.(7): Is this equation only presenting the position of
C_i and not the circle?
6) Eq. (8): Please give the expression of the rotation
matrix
