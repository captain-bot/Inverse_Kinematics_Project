Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents a novel approach to solving inverse
kinematics problems for robotic arms with 7 degrees of
freedom. The authors demonstrate that the proposed approach
is able to find multiple IK solutions, which is beneficial
in the presence of control and sensing uncertainty. The
experimental evaluation is adequate and includes comparison
with IKFast, which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for
solving IK problems.

The paper is well structured, and the contribution is
clearly explained, relevant and interesting. The paper
would benefit from a broader discussion of the existing
methods. The authors consider two main approaches to IK
problems: "Jacobian-based and geometric-based"; it would be
interesting to also consider papers where the authors are
generating smooth trajectories instead of solving IK
problems at single points, such as, for example,

Kris Hauser, Continuous Pseudoinversion of a Multivariate
Function: Application to Global Redundancy Resolution,
  
and

Daniel Rakita, Bilge Mutlu, Michael Gleicher. RelaxedIK:
Real-time Synthesis of Accurate and Feasible Robot Arm
Motion.


Although the paper is generally well structured, I
recommend the authors to improve the language. Here are
some of the typos:

*abstract: does not guarantee -- are not guaranteed
*page 1: ..known as redundancy resolution [] -- a reference
is missing
*page 3: as following -- as follows
*page 3: withing -- within
